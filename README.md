# BHAS - Node

This project contains the bare-metal firmware for a basic generic BHAS node.

Examples of such nodes include:

- Four Switch Node
- Master node

Currently this is still a work in progress and this firmware is more of a demo/test.

This firmware is part of the Bio Home Automation System - BHAS (pronounced BeeHas) and is currently designed for the Nucleo L467RG.
